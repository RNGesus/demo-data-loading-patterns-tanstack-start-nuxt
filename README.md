# TanStack Start playground

based on [TanStack Start "Getting Started" section](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/start/getting-started)

Well it is still a playground but I got the hang of it and will try to do more.
Next steps:

- [ ] add another app next to the tanstack start one to get a good comparison
- [ ] init a monorepo
  - [ ] apps:
    - [ ] tanstack start
    - [ ] nuxt
  - [ ] packages:
    - [ ] the railway station api
    - [ ] &hellip;

## start

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.33. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
